  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>My name is Lily Forman, and I am a rising senior at Hillsdale High School in San Mateo, California. This summer, I am participating in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Twitter in San Francisco! I am learning all about computer science, as well as possible careers. In my free time, I love to go on walks and play with my dog, Oreo, or hang out with my friends. I also enjoy watching TV, eating, and doing community service at the SPCA or through school clubs. When I get the opportunity, I also love traveling. I have been to several different countries, one of the most memorable being Japan!</p>

  <h3>My Work</h3>
  <p>During the first week of the program, we got familiar with Scratch, and began creating our own games! With my partner, Stephanie, I created a simple, point-based game that anyone can play! The goal is to use the space bar to help the firefighter jump from building to building, without touching the fire. The farther you go, the more points you get..</p>
