    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Lily Forman, and I am a rising senior at Hillsdale High School. This summer, I am participating in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Twitter in San Francisco! I am learning all about computer science, as well as possible careers. In my free time, I love to spend time with my dog, Oreo, or hang out with my friends. I also enjoy watching TV, eating, and occasionally doing community service. When I have the time, I also love traveling. I have been to several different countries, one of the most memorable being Japan!</P>
